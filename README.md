# Cabalesque

## Genre

Action/Arcade

## Overview

Cabalesque is a retro action-arcade shooter. Each player controls an elite soldier who must perform dangerous, high-action operations in conflict zones around the world. Every mission contains multiple stages, each of which is a single battlefield that must be overcome in order to progress.
An intuitive control scheme allows players to have their characters perform exciting manoeuvres within tightly constrained areas. Every war-torn landscape is presented with retro arcade-style graphics and low-fi sound effects. A gritty, instrumental soundtrack adds to the sensory experience throughout the game.
While mainly concerned with being a fast-paced and fun cooperative shooter, the underlying theme of Cabalesque is “war never changes”.

## Category

Cabalesque is a one or two-player cooperative shooting gallery action game that extends the functionality and control scheme of the original *[Cabal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabal_(video_game))*.

## Platforms

PC, Mac, Linux. Cabalesque is distributed via the Steam Workshop as a modification of Osumia Games' title: *[Running With Rifles](http://runningwithrifles.com)*.

## License

GNU Public. Currently there are no plans to license any parts of Cabalesque, but the gameplay could lend itself to a turn-based variant on mobile devices and physical formats.

## Play Mechanic
Each player controls a single infantry unit, who utilises a variety of ballistic and explosive weapons to engage increasingly intelligent and complex enemy infantry and vehicles on numerous, single-screen battlefields. A fixed, 3rd-person camera situated behind and slightly above the player characters watches the action unfold. Enemies appear from the sides and top of the battlefield, or from behind and within cover objects such as houses, machine gun nests, mobile armoured personnel carriers, and the like. Players can have their characters use these objects for cover or choose to destroy them in the hope of locating power-ups such as ammunition, more powerful weapons, or other special bonuses like airstrikes and supply crate drops.
Enemy units are constantly firing upon the player characters, who must evade these attacks by ducking/crouching, running or rolling from side to side, or advancing to the nearest cover object deeper in the battlefield.

## Technology

Cabalesque operates as an add-on modification to the gam *Running With Rifles*, which is built using the OGRE 3D engine. Cabal interfaces with the parent game via AngelScript, XML, shader, and OGRE material code.

## Target Audience

Males 13+. Older gamers will immediately appreciate the way Cabalesque focuses on addictive, arcade-style gameplay of yesteryear, while younger players will find the game accessible through its simple format and use of modern control devices.
