### Infantry

* Rifleman
The rifleman wears a long-sleeved, long-legged khaki uniform with black army boots, and carries a rifle that resembles an AK-47. This unit runs towards the player in a zig-zag fashion, pausing occasionally to fire a reasonably accurate, slow-moving, single shot in the direction of the player character before resuming.
  * SCUBA
  The scuba unit is a rifleman who is only found in water and wears a custom SCUBA suit. SCUBA units appear from their hiding positions under water then move a short distance left or right before firing a single shot at the player characters, moving again, and then returning to cover.
* Grenadier
These characters move from one side of the screen to the other, stopping occasionally to throw a grenade directly at one of the player characters.
* Commando
This unit is a combination of the Rifleman and Grenadier, and wears a custom uniform to designate his role in the Cabal. The commando wears a bulletproof vest that protects against the first two bullet impacts. The third bullet to strike the commando causes him to fall to the ground, wounded, and out of action unless healed.
* Medic
These unarmed units operate only to heal commandos who lie wounded on the battlefield.
